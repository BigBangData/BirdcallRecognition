## Synopsis

This repo was originally intended as a place to host my work in connection with the [Cornell Birdcall Identification Competition in Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/birdsong-recognition).

For "reasons", I ended up not entering this competition, but since I had all this fantastic audio and metadata on birdcall  identification, I held on to it just in case I thought of a use for it.

And in time, I did.

## A Birdcall Timer

My partner needed a customizable timer for sitting and standing while doing her computer work at a standup desk. 

She's also a bird-watching geek.

I created a simple timer that randomly draws from a collection of birdcalls and plays one, while also displaying some information about that bird.

## Demo

Here's a brief demo picture of the timer after a quick run using sub-minute wait times.

I'm hoping you can guess how the timer works - failing that, you could guess what the bright dot on my desktop backgroud is.
