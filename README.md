# Birdcall Recognition

## Synopsis

This repo was originally intended as a place to host my work in connection with the [Cornell Birdcall Identification Competition in Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/birdsong-recognition).

For "reasons", I ended up not entering this competition, but since I had all this fantastic audio and metadata on birdcall  identification, I held on to it just in case I thought of a use for it.

And in time, I did. You can see the project [here](https://github.com/BigBangData/BirdcallTimer).
